# Real-Life Financial Math Problems and Solutions

## 1. Budgeting
- **Problem**: You earn ₹50,000 per month and aim to save 20%.  
  **Solution**:  
  ```
  Savings = Income × Savings Percentage  
  Savings = ₹50,000 × 0.20 = ₹10,000
  ```  
  Remaining ₹40,000 can be allocated to expenses and other categories.

## 2. Loan Repayment
- **Problem**: Calculate the EMI for a ₹10,00,000 loan at 8% annual interest for 5 years.  
  **Formula**:  
  ```
  EMI = [P × r × (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]
  ```  
  Where:  
  P = ₹10,00,000, r = 0.08 / 12 = 0.00667, n = 5 × 12 = 60 months.  

  **Solution**:  
  ```
  EMI = ₹20,280 per month (approx)
  ```

## 3. Investing in Stocks
- **Problem**: ₹1,00,000 grows at 15% annually for 5 years.  
  **Formula**:  
  ```
  A = P × (1 + r)^t  
  A = ₹1,00,000 × (1 + 0.15)^5 = ₹2,01,136
  ```

...

## 10. Inflation Impact
- **Problem**: Inflation is 6% annually, how much is ₹1,00,000 worth in 10 years?  
  **Formula**:  
  ```
  Value = P × (1 - r)^t  
  Value = ₹1,00,000 × (1 - 0.06)^10 = ₹55,800
  ```
