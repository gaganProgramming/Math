### **Answers for JavaScript Variable Questions**
## 1
#### ** a) What are variables in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
A **variable** in JavaScript is a named storage location for data that can be used and modified during the execution of a program. It acts as a container to store values such as numbers, strings, objects, or other data types.  

#### **b) Why are variables important in JavaScript programming? (5 marks)**  
Variables are essential in JavaScript because:  
1. They **store and manage data** dynamically.  
2. They allow **reuse of values** throughout the program.  
3. They help in **writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code**.  
4. They enable **modifying values** without hardcoding.  
5. They improve **code readability and flexibility**.  

#### **c) What are the different types of variables in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
JavaScript provides three types of variable declarations:  

1. **var** – Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated. *(Older way, not recommended)*  
2. **let** – Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared within the same scope.  
3. **const** – Block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared once assigned.  

#### **d) How do you declare and use variables in JavaScript? Provide examples. (5 marks)**  
Variables in JavaScript are declared using **var, let, or const**:  

```javascript
// Using var
var name = "Gagan";  
console.log(name); // Output: Gagan

// Using let
let age = 25;  
age = 26;  
console.log(age); // Output: 26

// Using const
const country = "India";  
console.log(country); // Output: India
```

In the example:  
- `var` is used for older JavaScript versions.  
- `let` allows value modification but restricts redeclaration in the same scope.  
- `const` ensures that the value cannot be changed.

### **Answers for JavaScript Functions Questions**  

#### **a) What are functions in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
A **function** in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions take inputs (parameters), process them, and return an output (if needed). They help in writing modular, reusable, and efficient code.  

#### **b) Why do we use functions in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
Functions are used in JavaScript because:  
1. **Code Reusability** – Write once, use multiple times.  
2. **Modularity** – Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.  
3. **Maintainability** – Easier debugging and updating.  
4. **Better Readability** – Improves the structure of the code.  
5. **Avoiding Repetition** – Reduces redundancy in code.  

#### **c) What are the types of functions in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
JavaScript has different types of functions:  

1. **Function Declaration (Named Function)**  
   ```javascript
   function greet() { 
       console.log("Hello, World!"); 
   }
   ```
2. **Function Expression (Anonymous Function assigned to a variable)**  
   ```javascript
   let greet = function() { 
       console.log("Hello, World!"); 
   };
   ```
3. **Arrow Function (ES6 syntax)**  
   ```javascript
   let greet = () => console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```
4. **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**  
   ```javascript
   (function() { console.log("This runs immediately!"); })();
   ```
5. **Constructor Function**  
   ```javascript
   function Person(name) { 
       this.name = name; 
   }
   let person1 = new Person("Gagan");
   ```
6. **Generator Function**  
   ```javascript
   function* generator() {
       yield 1;
       yield 2;
   }
   ```

#### **d) How do you define and call a function in JavaScript? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  
A function is **defined** using the `function` keyword and is **called** by using its name followed by parentheses `()`.  

**Example: Function Definition & Calling**  
```javascript
// Function Definition
function add(a, b) {  
    return a + b;  
}

// Function Call
let result = add(5, 10);  
console.log(result); // Output: 15
```

**Explanation:**  
- `add(a, b)` is a function that takes two parameters and returns their sum.  
- `add(5, 10)` calls the function and stores the result in `result`.  
- `console.log(result)` prints `15` to the console.

### **Answers for JavaScript Events Questions**  

#### **a) What are JavaScript events? (5 marks)**  
JavaScript **events** are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as **clicks, key presses, mouse movements, form submissions, etc.** Events allow JavaScript to execute specific functions when a user interacts with a webpage.  

#### **b) Why are events used in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
Events are used in JavaScript to:  
1. **Make webpages interactive** (e.g., button clicks, form validation).  
2. **Respond to user actions** (e.g., keypress, mouseover).  
3. **Handle dynamic content changes** (e.g., updating UI elements).  
4. **Improve user experience** (e.g., animations, real-time updates).  
5. **Trigger functions automatically** (e.g., on page load, form submission).  

#### **c) What are the different types of JavaScript events? (5 marks)**  
JavaScript events are categorized as follows:  

1. **Mouse Events**: `click`, `dblclick`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `mousemove`  
2. **Keyboard Events**: `keydown`, `keyup`, `keypress`  
3. **Form Events**: `submit`, `reset`, `focus`, `blur`, `change`, `input`  
4. **Window Events**: `load`, `unload`, `scroll`, `resize`  
5. **Clipboard Events**: `copy`, `cut`, `paste`  
6. **Drag Events**: `drag`, `dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`  
7. **Touch Events** (for mobile devices): `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`  

#### **d) How do you handle an event in JavaScript? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  
Events can be handled using **Event Listeners**.  

**Example: Handling a Click Event**  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
<p id="message"></p>

<script>
// Selecting the button element
let button = document.getElementById("myButton");

// Adding an event listener to handle the click event
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
    document.getElementById("message").innerText = "Button Clicked!";
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**  
- The **`click` event** is attached to the button using `addEventListener()`.  
- When the button is clicked, the text inside the `<p>` element updates dynamically.

### **Answers for JavaScript Promises Questions**  

#### **a) What is a JavaScript Promise? (5 marks)**  
A **JavaScript Promise** is an object that represents the eventual **completion or failure** of an asynchronous operation. It is used to handle asynchronous operations more efficiently than callbacks.  

#### **b) Why are Promises used in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
Promises are used in JavaScript to:  
1. **Handle asynchronous operations** (e.g., fetching data from an API).  
2. **Improve code readability** compared to callback-based approaches.  
3. **Avoid callback hell** (nested callbacks that make code complex).  
4. **Manage multiple asynchronous tasks** in a more structured way.  
5. **Support chaining** (`then()`, `catch()`, `finally()`) for better control.  

#### **c) What are the different states of a Promise? (5 marks)**  
A JavaScript Promise has three possible states:  

1. **Pending** – The initial state, where the promise is neither resolved nor rejected.  
2. **Fulfilled (Resolved)** – The operation is completed successfully.  
3. **Rejected** – The operation failed due to an error.  

#### **d) How do you create and use a Promise in JavaScript? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  

**Example: Creating and Using a Promise**  
```javascript
// Creating a Promise
let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let success = true; // Simulating success
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (success) {
            resolve("Promise Resolved: Data fetched successfully!");
        } else {
            reject("Promise Rejected: Error in fetching data!");
        }
    }, 2000);
});

// Using the Promise
myPromise
    .then((message) => console.log(message)) // Executes when resolved
    .catch((error) => console.log(error))   // Executes when rejected
    .finally(() => console.log("Promise Completed.")); // Always executes
```

**Explanation:**  
- The `Promise` is created with `resolve` (for success) and `reject` (for failure).  
- After **2 seconds**, the promise is either **resolved** or **rejected**.  
- `.then()` handles the **successful** response.  
- `.catch()` handles the **error** if the promise is rejected.  
- `.finally()` runs regardless of success or failure.

8. **Modules (`import/export`)** – Enabling modular JavaScript.  
9. **Classes** – Object-oriented programming support.  
10. **Enhanced Object Literals** – Simplified syntax for object properties and methods.  

#### **d) How do you implement at least one ES6 feature in JavaScript? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  

**Example: Using Arrow Functions (`=>`)**  
```javascript
// ES5 (Before ES6)
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
console.log(add(5, 10)); // Output: 15

// ES6 (Using Arrow Function)
const addES6 = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(addES6(5, 10)); // Output: 15
```

**Explanation:**

### **Answers for JavaScript Scope Questions**  

#### **a) What is scope in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
**Scope** in JavaScript defines the **accessibility** and **lifetime** of variables. It determines where a variable can be used in the program.  

#### **b) Why is scope important in JavaScript programming? (5 marks)**  
Scope is important because:  
1. **Prevents Variable Conflicts** – Variables inside functions don’t interfere with global variables.  
2. **Encapsulates Code** – Limits access to variables, improving security and maintainability.  
3. **Optimizes Memory Usage** – Local variables are automatically removed when functions finish execution.  
4. **Improves Debugging** – Knowing variable scope helps prevent unintended modifications.  
5. **Enhances Performance** – Local variables are accessed faster than global ones.  

#### **c) What are the types of scope in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
1. **Global Scope** – Variables declared outside any function or block, accessible anywhere.  
2. **Local (Function) Scope** – Variables declared inside a function, accessible only within that function.  
3. **Block Scope (ES6)** – Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside `{}` blocks, accessible only within that block.  
4. **Lexical Scope (Closure)** – Inner functions can access variables from their parent function.  

#### **d) How does JavaScript handle scope? Provide examples. (5 marks)**  

### **Example: Global and Local Scope**
```javascript
let globalVar = "I am global"; // Global Scope

function testScope() {
    let localVar = "I am local"; // Function Scope
    console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
    console.log(localVar); // Accessible
}

testScope();
console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
// console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
```
🔹 **Explanation**:  
- `globalVar` is accessible **inside and outside** the function.  
- `localVar` is **only accessible inside** the function and gives an error outside.  

---

### **Example: Block Scope (`let` & `const`)**
```javascript
if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I exist only inside this block";
    console.log(blockVar); // Works inside the block
}
// console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined
```
🔹 **Explanation**: `let` and `const` restrict the variable **inside the block `{}`**.  

---

### **Example: Lexical Scope (Closures)**
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVar = "I am from outer function";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVar); // Accessible due to lexical scope
    }
    
    innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```
🔹 **Explanation**: The `innerFunction()` **inherits** `outerVar` due to **lexical scoping**.

##7
### **Answers for JavaScript Closures Questions**  

#### **a) What is a closure in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
A **closure** is a function that **remembers** the variables from its **outer scope** even after the outer function has finished execution.  

**Example of a closure:**  
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    let count = 0; // Local variable in outer function

    return function innerFunction() {
        count++; // Inner function remembers 'count'
        console.log(count);
    };
}

const counter = outerFunction();
counter(); // Output: 1
counter(); // Output: 2
```
🔹 **Explanation**:  
- `innerFunction` **remembers** the variable `count` from `outerFunction`, even after `outerFunction` has completed execution.  

---

#### **b) Why are closures used in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
Closures are used for:  
1. **Data Encapsulation** – Keeps variables private, avoiding accidental changes.  
2. **Maintaining State** – Useful in counter implementations or session tracking.  
3. **Creating Function Factories** – Generating multiple instances with their own private data.  
4. **Event Handling** – Used in callback functions and event listeners.  
5. **Module Design Pattern** – Helps in creating private variables and methods.  

---

#### **c) What are the advantages of using closures? (5 marks)**  
1. **Data Privacy** – Variables inside a closure can’t be accessed directly from outside.  
2. **Avoids Global Variables** – Reduces namespace pollution by keeping variables in function scope.  
3. **Memory Efficiency** – Unused variables are garbage collected while still keeping needed data.  
4. **Better Code Organization** – Helps structure modular and reusable code.  
5. **Useful in Callbacks & Async Programming** – Often used in `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and event listeners.  

---

#### **d) How do you implement a closure in JavaScript? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  

### **Example: Closure for a Counter Function**
```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // Private variable

    return {
        increment: function() {
            count++;
            console.log("Count:", count);
        },
        decrement: function() {
            count--;
            console.log("Count:", count);
        }
    };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment(); // Output: Count: 1
counter.increment(); // Output: Count: 2
counter.decrement(); // Output: Count: 1
```
🔹 **Explanation**:  
- `count` is **private** inside `createCounter()`.  
- The returned object exposes `increment` and `decrement` methods but **does not expose `count` directly**.

### **Answers for JavaScript Asynchronous Programming Questions**  

#### **a) What is asynchronous programming in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
**Asynchronous programming** in JavaScript allows tasks to execute **without blocking** the main thread. Instead of waiting for one task to finish before moving to the next, JavaScript can continue executing other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous task to complete.  

**Example of asynchronous behavior:**  
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```
🔹 **Output:**  
```
Start
End
This runs after 2 seconds
```
🔹 **Explanation**: `setTimeout()` runs asynchronously, allowing `console.log("End")` to execute before it finishes.  

---

#### **b) Why is asynchronous programming important? (5 marks)**  
Asynchronous programming is important because:  
1. **Non-blocking Execution** – Prevents delays in UI responsiveness.  
2. **Efficient Resource Usage** – JavaScript can continue other tasks instead of waiting.  
3. **Faster Performance** – Improves execution speed for network and file operations.  
4. **Better User Experience** – Avoids UI freezing, improving interactivity.  
5. **Essential for API Calls** – Fetching data from servers requires asynchronous behavior.  

---

#### **c) What are the different ways to handle asynchronous programming in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
JavaScript provides multiple ways to handle asynchronous code:  

1. **Callbacks** – Passing a function as an argument to be executed later.  
   ```javascript
   function fetchData(callback) {
       setTimeout(() => {
           callback("Data received");
       }, 2000);
   }

   fetchData((message) => console.log(message));
   ```

2. **Promises** – An object representing a future value, avoiding callback nesting.  
   ```javascript
   let promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
       setTimeout(() => resolve("Data received"), 2000);
   });

   promise.then((message) => console.log(message));
   ```

3. **Async/Await** – A cleaner way to handle promises.  
   ```javascript
   async function getData() {
       let response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
       let data = await response.json();
       console.log(data);
   }
   getData();
   ```

---

#### **d) How do you implement asynchronous programming using `async` and `await`? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  

### **Example: Fetching Data using `async/await`**
```javascript
async function fetchUserData() {
    try {
        console.log("Fetching data...");
        let response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1");
        let user = await response.json();
        console.log("User Data:", user);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("Error fetching data:", error);
    }
}

fetchUserData();
```
🔹 **Explanation**:  
- The function `fetchUserData()` is marked as `async`, allowing it to use `await`.  
- `await` ensures that `fetch()` completes before moving to the next line.  
- The `try...catch` block handles errors if the request fails.

### **Answers for JavaScript DOM Manipulation Questions**  

#### **a) What is the DOM in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
The **DOM (Document Object Model)** is a programming interface that represents an **HTML or XML document** as a **tree structure**, where each node corresponds to an element in the document. It allows JavaScript to dynamically **access, modify, and manipulate** webpage content.  

**Example DOM Structure for an HTML Page:**  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>DOM Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="heading">Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
🔹 **In JavaScript, the above HTML is represented as a DOM tree:**  
```
Document
└── html
    ├── head
    │   └── title
    └── body
        └── h1 (id="heading") → "Hello, World!"
```
🔹 JavaScript can access and modify this structure using the `document` object.  

---

#### **b) Why do we use DOM manipulation in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
DOM manipulation is used for:  
1. **Updating Content Dynamically** – Change text, images, styles, etc. without reloading the page.

3. **Creating Interactive Webpages** – Enhance UX by showing/hiding elements dynamically.  
4. **Modifying Styles and Layouts** – Change CSS properties in real time.  
5. **Fetching & Displaying Data** – Insert data retrieved from APIs into the webpage.  

---

#### **c) What are different methods to manipulate the DOM? (5 marks)**  
JavaScript provides several methods to manipulate the DOM:  

1. **Selecting Elements**  
   - `document.getElementById("id")` – Selects an element by ID.  
   - `document.querySelector(".class")` – Selects the first matching element by class or tag.  
   - `document.getElementsByTagName("tag")` – Selects all elements of a given tag.  

2. **Modifying Content**  
   - `element.innerHTML` – Changes the inner content (HTML) of an element.  
   - `element.textContent` – Changes only the text content (ignores HTML).  

3. **Modifying Attributes**  
   - `element.setAttribute("attribute", "value")` – Changes or adds an attribute.  
   - `element.classList.add("class-name")` – Adds a new CSS class.  
   - `element.classList.remove("class-name")` – Removes an existing CSS class.  

4. **Event Handling**  
   - `element.addEventListener("click", function)` – Attaches an event listener to an element.  

5. **Creating and Removing Elements**  
   - `document.createElement("tag")` – Creates a new HTML element.  
   - `element.appendChild(newElement)` – Adds a new element to the DOM.  
   - `element.removeChild(childElement)` – Removes an element from the DOM.  

---

#### **d) How do you change the content of an HTML element using JavaScript? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  

### **Example: Changing Content Using JavaScript**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

    <script>
        function changeText() {
            document.getElementById("title").innerHTML = "New Heading Updated!";
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
🔹 **Explanation**:  
- Initially, `<h1>` displays `"Original Heading"`.  
- When the button is clicked, the `changeText()` function executes, modifying the text to `"New Heading Updated!"` using `document.getElementById("title").innerHTML`.

2. **Enhances Debugging** – Helps developers identify and fix issues more efficiently.  
3. **Improves User Experience** – Displays meaningful error messages instead of showing raw error codes.  
4. **Ensures Code Reliability** – Allows code to execute smoothly even when unexpected errors occur.  
5. **Handles Asynchronous Errors** – Helps manage errors in async operations like API calls and file handling.  

---

#### **c) What are different types of errors in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  

JavaScript errors can be categorized as:  

1. **Syntax Errors** – Occur when there is incorrect JavaScript syntax.  
   ```js
   console.log("Hello World" // Missing closing parenthesis
   ```
   **Error:** `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input`  

2. **Reference Errors** – Occur when trying to use an undefined variable.  
   ```js
   console.log(myVariable); // myVariable is not defined
   ```
   **Error:** `ReferenceError: myVariable is not defined`  

3. **Type Errors** – Occur when an operation is performed on a value of the wrong type.  
   ```js
   let num = 5;
   num.toUpperCase(); // Numbers don’t have toUpperCase() method
   ```
   **Error:** `TypeError: num.toUpperCase is not a function`  

4. **Range Errors** – Occur when a value is out of the expected range.  
   ```js
   let arr = new Array(-1); // Negative size is not allowed
   ```
   **Error:** `RangeError: Invalid array length`  

5. **URI Errors** – Occur when using `decodeURI()` or `encodeURI()` incorrectly.  
   ```js
   decodeURI("%"); // Incomplete URI encoding
   ```
   **Error:** `URIError: URI malformed`  

6. **Eval Errors** – Occur when using the `eval()` function incorrectly (rarely seen in modern JavaScript).  
   ```js
   eval("alert('Hello)"); // Missing closing quote
   ```
   **Error:** `EvalError: Unexpected string`  

---

#### **d) How do you use try...catch for error handling? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  

### **Example: Using `try...catch` for Error Handling**
```js
try {
    let num = undefined;
    console.log(num.toUpperCase()); // This will throw a TypeError
} catch (error) {
    console.log("An error occurred: " + error.message);
} finally {
    console.log("Execution completed.");
}
```

🔹 **Explanation:**  
- The `try` block contains code that may throw an error.  
- The `catch` block catches the error and prevents the program from crashing.  
- The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an error occurs, ensuring cleanup or final operations.

### **Answers for JavaScript Prototype & Inheritance Questions**  

#### **a) What is a prototype in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
A **prototype** in JavaScript is an object from which other objects inherit properties. Every JavaScript function has a `prototype` property that allows adding methods and properties to objects created using that function.

📌 **Example:**  
```js
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}
console.log(Person.prototype); // Output: {} (an empty object by default)
```

---

#### **b) Why is prototype-based inheritance used in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
Prototype-based inheritance is used in JavaScript for:  

1. **Memory Efficiency** – Instead of copying methods for each object, they are shared via the prototype.  
2. **Code Reusability** – Common functionalities are defined once in the prototype and used by multiple objects.  
3. **Dynamic Inheritance** – Properties and methods can be added to the prototype even after object creation.  
4. **Flexibility** – Unlike classical inheritance, prototype-based inheritance allows modifying objects directly.

📌 **Example (Prototype Sharing Methods):**  
```js
function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}
Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
    console.log(this.name + " makes a noise.");
};

let dog = new Animal("Dog");
dog.speak(); // Output: Dog makes a noise.
```

---

#### **c) What are the differences between prototypal and classical inheritance? (5 marks)**  

| Feature | Prototypal Inheritance | Classical Inheritance |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Definition** | Objects inherit directly from other objects. | Classes define a blueprint from which objects are created. |
| **Flexibility** | More flexible and dynamic. | More structured and rigid. |
| **Method Sharing** | Methods are stored in a shared prototype. | Methods are copied to each instance. |
| **Example** | `Object.create(prototype)` | `class` and `extends` keywords |
| **Usage** | Common in JavaScript. | Common in Java, C++, and Python. |

---

#### **d) How do you create and use prototypes in JavaScript? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  

**Creating and Using Prototypes:**
1. Define a constructor function.
2. Attach methods to the `prototype` property.
3. Create objects that inherit from the prototype.

📌 **Example of Prototype Inheritance:**  
```js
function Vehicle(type) {
    this.type = type;
}

// Adding a method to the prototype
Vehicle.prototype.describe = function() {
    console.log("This is a " + this.type);
};

// Creating objects
let car = new Vehicle("Car");
let bike = new Vehicle("Bike");

car.describe(); // Output: This is a Car
bike.describe(); // Output: This is a Bike
```

### **Answers for JavaScript Event Loop Questions**  

#### **a) What is the event loop in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
The **event loop** is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles **asynchronous** operations by continuously checking the **call stack** and the **callback queue**, ensuring that non-blocking code executes efficiently. It allows JavaScript to remain **single-threaded** while still handling asynchronous tasks.

📌 **Key Points:**  
- Works with the **call stack, callback queue, and microtask queue**.  
- Helps JavaScript execute **non-blocking** code like setTimeout, Promises, and event listeners.  
- Runs indefinitely, checking if tasks need to be executed.  

---

#### **b) Why is the event loop important in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
The event loop is crucial in JavaScript because:  

1. **Handles Asynchronous Operations** – It allows JavaScript to manage tasks like HTTP requests, timers, and I/O operations without blocking execution.  
2. **Ensures Responsiveness** – It prevents UI from freezing by scheduling tasks efficiently.  
3. **Manages Execution Order** – Ensures synchronous code runs first while handling deferred tasks like Promises and event listeners later.  
4. **Optimizes Performance** – JavaScript can execute time-consuming operations efficiently without waiting for each one to complete.  

📌 **Example (Without the Event Loop, JavaScript would be Blocking):**  
```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```
**Output:**  
```
Start  
End  
Inside setTimeout (after 1 second)
```
The event loop ensures `setTimeout` runs **after** synchronous code execution.

---

#### **c) What are the different phases of the event loop? (5 marks)**  
The event loop consists of several phases that determine the order of execution:  

| **Phase**             | **Description** |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| **Call Stack**       | Executes synchronous code (e.g., function calls, loops, etc.). |
| **Microtask Queue**  | Handles promises (`.then`, `async/await`), executed **before** other asynchronous tasks. |
| **Macrotask Queue**  | Handles `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate`, I/O operations. |
| **Event Handling**   | Executes event listeners (e.g., `click`, `keydown`, `DOMContentLoaded`). |
| **Rendering**        | Updates the UI when necessary (browser repaints). |

📌 **Order of Execution:**  
1. **Call Stack** → 2. **Microtask Queue (Promises, Mutation Observers)** → 3. **Macrotask Queue (setTimeout, I/O)**  

---

#### **d) How does the event loop handle asynchronous operations? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  
The event loop moves asynchronous tasks (like **setTimeout**, **Promises**) to different queues and executes them **only when the call stack is empty**.  

📌 **Example of Event Loop Handling Async Operations:**  
```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise resolved"));

console.log("End");
```
**Execution Flow:**  
1. `"Start"` is printed (**synchronous**).  
2. `setTimeout` is moved to the **Macrotask Queue**.  
3. `Promise.resolve().then(...)` is moved to the **Microtask Queue**.  
4. `"End"` is printed (**synchronous**).  
5. The event loop **prioritizes** the **Microtask Queue**, so `"Promise resolved"` runs.  
6. Finally, `"setTimeout"` is executed from the **Macrotask Queue**.  

**Output:**  
```
Start  
End  
Promise resolved  
setTimeout
```

---

### **Final Answer Summary**  
| **Question** | **Answer Summary** |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **a) What is the event loop in JavaScript?** | A mechanism that manages asynchronous execution by coordinating the call stack, microtask queue, and macrotask queue. |
| **b) Why is the event loop important?** | It enables non-blocking code execution, improves responsiveness, and optimizes performance. |
| **c) What are the different phases?** | Call Stack, Microtask Queue (Promises), Macrotask Queue (setTimeout, I/O), Event Handling, and Rendering. |
| **d) How does it handle async operations?** | Moves tasks to different queues, prioritizing Microtask Queue before Macrotask Queue. |

```

✅ **Step 2: Import the Module in Another File (`app.js`)**
```js
// Importing functions in app.js
import { add, multiply } from './mathUtils.js';

console.log(add(5, 3));       // Output: 8
console.log(multiply(4, 2));  // Output: 8
```

✅ **Step 3: Using Default Export (`defaultExport.js`)**
```js
// Exporting a default function
export default function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
```js
// Importing the default export
import greet from './defaultExport.js';

console.log(greet("Gagan")); // Output: Hello, Gagan!
```

✅ **Step 4: Using Modules in HTML**
```html
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
```
📌 **Note:** `type="module"` is needed to use ES6 modules in browsers.

### **Answers for Callback Functions in JavaScript**  

#### **a) What is a callback function in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
A **callback function** is a function that is **passed as an argument** to another function and is executed **later**, after the completion of an operation.  

📌 **Definition:**  
> A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as an argument and is executed after the completion of that function.  

📌 **Example:**  
```js
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
    callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("Gagan", sayGoodbye);
```
📌 **Output:**  
```
Hello, Gagan
Goodbye!
```
---

#### **b) Why are callbacks used in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
Callbacks are mainly used for:  

1. **Handling Asynchronous Operations** – Used in AJAX calls, file reading, and setTimeout.  
2. **Executing Code in Sequence** – Ensures a function executes only after another finishes.  
3. **Avoiding Blocking Code** – Prevents JavaScript from waiting for long-running operations.  
4. **Event Handling** – Used in DOM event listeners.  
5. **Higher-Order Functions** – Functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` use callbacks.  

✅ **Example of a callback in an asynchronous operation:**  
```js
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This message appears after 2 seconds.");
}, 2000);
```
---

#### **c) What are synchronous and asynchronous callbacks? (5 marks)**  

| **Callback Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Synchronous Callbacks** | Executed immediately within the function call, blocking further execution. | `array.forEach(callback)` |
| **Asynchronous Callbacks** | Executed after an operation completes (e.g., I/O, timers, API calls), allowing non-blocking execution. | `setTimeout(callback, time)` |

📌 **Synchronous Callback Example:**  
```js
function processArray(arr, callback) {
    arr.forEach(callback);
}

processArray([1, 2, 3], (num) => console.log(num * 2));
```
📌 **Output:**  
```
2
4
6
```

📌 **Asynchronous Callback Example (Fetching Data):**  
```js
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched!");
        callback();
    }, 3000);
}

fetchData(() => {
    console.log("Processing data...");
});
```
📌 **Output (After 3 seconds delay):**  
```
Data fetched!
Processing data...
```
---

#### **d) How do you implement a callback function in JavaScript? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  
📌 **Example: Implementing a Callback Function**  
```js
function calculate(a, b, operation) {
    return operation(a, b);
}

// Callback functions
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}

// Using the callback
console.log(calculate(5, 3, add));      // Output: 8
console.log(calculate(5, 3, multiply)); // Output: 15
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- `calculate()` takes two numbers and a callback function (`operation`).  
- `add()` and `multiply()` are passed as callbacks.  
- The function executes the operation dynamically.  

---

### **Final Answer Summary**  
| **Question** | **Answer Summary** |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **a) What is a callback function?** | A function passed as an argument to another function and executed later. |
| **b) Why are callbacks used?** | Used for asynchronous programming, event handling, and executing code in sequence. |
| **c) What are synchronous and asynchronous callbacks?** | Synchronous executes immediately (e.g., `forEach`), asynchronous executes later (e.g., `setTimeout`). |
| **d) How to implement a callback function?** | Use a function that takes another function as an argument and executes it later. |

### **Answers for Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript**  

#### **a) What is a higher-order function in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
A **higher-order function** is a function that does either of the following:  
1. **Takes another function as an argument**  
2. **Returns a function as its output**  

📌 **Definition:**  
> A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result.  

📌 **Example:**  
```js
function higherOrder(func) {
    console.log("Executing function...");
    func();  // Calling the passed function
}

higherOrder(() => console.log("Hello from callback!"));
```
📌 **Output:**  
```
Executing function...
Hello from callback!
```
---

#### **b) Why do we use higher-order functions? (5 marks)**  
Higher-order functions are used for:  

1. **Code Reusability** – Avoids writing repetitive code.  
2. **Abstraction** – Makes functions more generic and flexible.  
3. **Functional Programming** – Enables operations like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.  
4. **Asynchronous Programming** – Used in event handling and promises.  
5. **Better Readability** – Reduces clutter and makes code easier to understand.  

✅ **Example: Using a Higher-Order Function for Reusability**  
```js
function repeat(n, action) {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        action(i);
    }
}

repeat(3, console.log);
```
📌 **Output:**  
```
0
1
2
```
---

#### **c) What are some common higher-order functions in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  

| **Function** | **Description** | **Example** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| `map()` | Creates a new array by applying a function to each element. | `[1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2) // [2, 4, 6]` |
| `filter()` | Creates a new array with elements that pass a condition. | `[1, 2, 3, 4].filter(x => x % 2 === 0) // [2, 4]` |
| `reduce()` | Reduces an array to a single value. | `[1, 2, 3].reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0) // 6` |
| `forEach()` | Iterates over an array without returning a new one. | `[1, 2, 3].forEach(x => console.log(x))` |
| `sort()` | Sorts elements of an array. | `[3, 1, 4, 2].sort((a, b) => a - b) // [1, 2, 3, 4]` |

✅ **Example: Using `map()` as a Higher-Order Function**  
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
---

#### **d) How do you implement a higher-order function? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  

📌 **Example: Creating a Higher-Order Function**  
```js
function multiplyBy(factor) {
    return function (number) {
        return number * factor;
    };
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Output: 15
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- `multiplyBy(factor)` is a **higher-order function** because it **returns another function**.  
- `double` and `triple` store different versions of the function.  
- Calling `double(5)` applies `factor = 2`, so the result is **10**.

### **Answers for Fetch API in JavaScript**  

#### **a) What is the Fetch API in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
📌 **Definition:**  
The **Fetch API** is a modern interface in JavaScript used to make HTTP requests to servers and handle responses asynchronously. It returns a **Promise**, which simplifies working with asynchronous data fetching.  

✅ **Key Features:**  
- Uses Promises instead of callbacks.  
- Supports asynchronous programming.  
- Handles JSON, text, and binary responses.  
- Provides better error handling than `XMLHttpRequest`.  

✅ **Basic Syntax:**  
```js
fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```
---

#### **b) Why is the Fetch API preferred over XMLHttpRequest? (5 marks)**  
✅ **Advantages of Fetch API over XMLHttpRequest:**  

| Feature | Fetch API | XMLHttpRequest (XHR) |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Syntax** | Cleaner and promise-based | Uses callbacks (more complex) |
| **Asynchronous Handling** | Uses Promises (`.then()` / `async-await`) | Uses event listeners (`onreadystatechange`) |
| **Error Handling** | Easier with `.catch()` | More manual error handling required |
| **JSON Parsing** | `response.json()` simplifies parsing | Needs `JSON.parse()` manually |
| **Better Response Handling** | Supports streaming and response cloning | Limited handling |

📌 **Example of XMLHTTPRequest (Old Method)**  
```js
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "https://api.example.com/data", true);
xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
        console.log(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
    }
};
xhr.send();
```
📌 **Example of Fetch API (Modern Method)**  
```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```
**Result:** The Fetch API makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

---

#### **c) What are the different response types in the Fetch API? (5 marks)**  
📌 **Response types in Fetch API:**  

| Response Type | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `response.text()` | Reads response as plain text | `response.text().then(text => console.log(text))` |
| `response.json()` | Parses response as JSON | `response.json().then(data => console.log(data))` |
| `response.blob()` | Reads response as binary data (images, files) | `response.blob().then(blob => console.log(blob))` |
| `response.arrayBuffer()` | Reads response as raw binary data | `response.arrayBuffer().then(buffer => console.log(buffer))` |
| `response.formData()` | Reads response as FormData (used in file uploads) | `response.formData().then(formData => console.log(formData))` |

✅ **Example:**  
```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
    .then(response => response.json())  // JSON response type
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```
---

#### **d) How do you use the Fetch API to make an API call? Provide an example. (5 marks)**  
✅ **Example: Fetching data from an API**  
```js
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
    .then(response => response.json()) // Convert response to JSON
    .then(data => console.log(data)) // Output data
    .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```
📌 **Output:**  
```json
{
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Sample Title",
    "body": "This is a sample post."
}
```
✅ **Example: Making a POST request with Fetch API**  
```js
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        title: "New Post",
        body: "This is the post content.",
        userId: 1
    })
})
    .then(response => response.json()) // Parse response
    .then(data => console.log(data)) // Output response data
    .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```
📌 **Output:**  
```json
{
    "title": "New Post",
    "body": "This is the post content.",
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 101
}

### **Answers for `setTimeout` and `setInterval` in JavaScript**  

---

### **a) What are `setTimeout` and `setInterval` in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
📌 **Definition:**  
- **`setTimeout`** is a JavaScript function that **executes a function after a specified delay** (in milliseconds). It runs **only once** after the delay.  
- **`setInterval`** is a JavaScript function that **executes a function repeatedly at specified time intervals** (in milliseconds) until manually stopped.  

✅ **Basic Syntax:**  
```js
setTimeout(function, delay);
setInterval(function, interval);
```

---

### **b) Why are `setTimeout` and `setInterval` used? (5 marks)**  
✅ **Purpose & Use Cases:**  
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `setTimeout` | Used when a function needs to be executed **only once after a delay** (e.g., showing a notification, delaying execution). |
| `setInterval` | Used when a function needs to be executed **repeatedly at fixed time intervals** (e.g., updating a clock, refreshing data, animations). |

📌 **Example Use Cases:**  
- **`setTimeout`**: Display a welcome message after 5 seconds.  
- **`setInterval`**: Update a digital clock every second.  

---

### **c) What are the differences between `setTimeout` and `setInterval`? (5 marks)**  
| Feature | `setTimeout` | `setInterval` |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Execution** | Runs **once** after a specified delay. | Runs **repeatedly** at fixed intervals. |
| **Usage** | Useful for delayed execution. | Useful for repeated tasks like animations or clocks. |
| **Clearing the timer** | `clearTimeout(timerId);` | `clearInterval(timerId);` |

✅ **Example Difference:**  
```js
// Runs once after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => console.log("Executed once after 3 seconds"), 3000);

// Runs every 2 seconds
setInterval(() => console.log("Repeats every 2 seconds"), 2000);
```

---

### **d) How do you use `setTimeout` and `setInterval` in JavaScript? Provide examples. (5 marks)**  

✅ **Example 1: Using `setTimeout` (Runs Once After Delay)**  
```js
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Hello! This message appears after 3 seconds.");
}, 3000);
```
📌 **Output (after 3 seconds):**  
```
Hello! This message appears after 3 seconds.
```

✅ **Example 2: Using `setInterval` (Repeats at Intervals)**  
```js
let counter = 1;
let intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    console.log(`Message ${counter}`);
    counter++;

    if (counter > 5) {  // Stop after 5 times
        clearInterval(intervalId);
        console.log("Stopped Interval!");
    }
}, 1000);
```
📌 **Output (every second, stops after 5 times):**  
```
Message 1
Message 2
Message 3
Message 4
Message 5
Stopped Interval!
```

✅ **Example 3: Clearing `setTimeout` Before Execution**  
```js
let timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This will not be printed.");
}, 5000);

// Cancel the timeout before execution
clearTimeout(timeoutId);
console.log("setTimeout cleared before execution.");
```
📌 **Output:**  
```
setTimeout cleared before execution.
```

✅ **Example 4: Clearing `setInterval` After Some Time**  
```js
let intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Running every 2 seconds...");
}, 2000);

setTimeout(() => {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    console.log("Stopped the repeating function.");
}, 10000); // Stops interval after 10 seconds
```
📌 **Output:**  
```
Running every 2 seconds...
Running every 2 seconds...
Running every 2 seconds...
Running every 2 seconds...
Stopped the repeating function.
```

### **Answers for `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` in JavaScript**  

---

### **a) What are `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` in JavaScript? (5 marks)**  
📌 **Definition:**  
- **`WeakMap`** is a special kind of `Map` that **only allows objects as keys** and holds them **weakly**, meaning the objects can be garbage collected when no longer referenced.  
- **`WeakSet`** is a special kind of `Set` that **only stores objects** and also holds them **weakly**, allowing garbage collection.  

✅ **Key Features:**  
- Stores **only objects** (not primitive values like numbers or strings).  
- **Weak references**: Objects are **automatically removed** when no longer referenced.  
- **Not iterable**: Unlike `Map` and `Set`, `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` cannot be iterated over.  

---

### **b) Why are `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` useful? (5 marks)**  

✅ **Benefits:**  
| Feature | `WeakMap` / `WeakSet` Benefit |
|---------|------------------------------|
| **Automatic Garbage Collection** | Prevents memory leaks by allowing objects to be garbage collected when not in use. |
| **Performance Optimization** | Since weakly held objects are removed automatically, it improves memory management. |
| **Use Case: Private Data Storage** | `WeakMap` can store private data for objects without affecting garbage collection. |

📌 **Example Use Case:**  
- **`WeakMap`** is useful for **storing metadata** (e.g., caching, DOM elements, private object properties).  
- **`WeakSet`** is useful for **tracking objects without preventing garbage collection**.  

---

### **c) What are the differences between `Map`/`Set` and `WeakMap`/`WeakSet`? (5 marks)**  

| Feature | `Map` / `Set` | `WeakMap` / `WeakSet` |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Keys/Values** | Can store **any type** of key/value. | Can store **only objects** as keys (WeakMap) or values (WeakSet). |
| **Garbage Collection** | Objects remain in memory even if not used. | Objects are **automatically garbage collected** when unreferenced. |
| **Iteration** | Supports `.forEach()`, `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.entries()`. | **Not iterable** – no `.forEach()` or `.keys()`. |
| **Size Property** | Has `.size` property to check count. | **No `.size` property**. |
| **Use Case** | General-purpose key-value or set collections. | Efficient temporary storage of objects, preventing memory leaks. |

---

### **d) How do you create and use `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`? Provide examples. (5 marks)**  

✅ **Example 1: Creating and Using `WeakMap`**  
```js
let user1 = { name: "Alice" };
let user2 = { name: "Bob" };

let weakMap = new WeakMap();
weakMap.set(user1, "Admin");
weakMap.set(user2, "Editor");

console.log(weakMap.get(user1)); // Output: "Admin"

user1 = null; // Now Alice can be garbage collected
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- `user1` and `user2` are stored as keys.  
- When `user1 = null`, the object `{ name: "Alice" }` is garbage collected.  

---

✅ **Example 2: Creating and Using `WeakSet`**  
```js
let obj1 = { id: 1 };
let obj2 = { id: 2 };

let weakSet = new WeakSet();
weakSet.add(obj1);
weakSet.add(obj2);

console.log(weakSet.has(obj1)); // Output: true

obj1 = null; // obj1 can now be garbage collected
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
- `WeakSet` stores objects **weakly**, meaning `obj1` can be garbage collected when set to `null`.  

---

### **Final Answer Summary**  

| **Question** | **Answer Summary** |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **a) What are `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`?** | `WeakMap` stores key-value pairs **with objects as keys**, `WeakSet` stores **only objects**. Both allow garbage collection. |
| **b) Why are they useful?** | Prevent **memory leaks**, optimize **performance**, and store **private metadata**. |
| **c) Differences from `Map`/`Set`?** | No iteration, no `.size`, objects as keys only, and automatic garbage collection. |
| **d) Examples?** | `weakMap.set(obj, value); weakSet.add(obj);` with garbage collection support. |
